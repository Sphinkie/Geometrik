# Geometrik

The **Geometrik Library** is a C++ library that allows you to create easily and dynamically various spheric 3D shapes (meshes).
The **Geometrik Library** is designed to work with the **Ogre3D** Game engine, but can be easily adapted to work with any other C++ environment.
The library offers several classes to create dynamically geometric 3D-meshes (like cubes, spheres, ellipsoids...).

The API description is provided in the [Library home page](https://sphinkie.github.io/Geometrik/index.html).

## Samples
Here are some 3D objects that you can create with the library (without and with texture):

## Credits

This C++ library is based on the theoric and mathematical book _"Geodesic Math & How to Use It"_ by Hugh Kenner, 1976, University of California Press. (ISBN 0-520-02924-0).  

It also refers to the C program of Richard J. Bono (http://mathforum.org/library/view/8321.html)
