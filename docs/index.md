# Geometrik

## Description

When runing your Ogre-3D program, you may need a runtime-generated 3D object (*mesh*).
For example, entering in a *solar system*, you may need to generate several spheres with diff√©rent diameters on-
the-fly.

This is now possible with the **Geometrik Library**.

![ogre3d](https://www.ogre3d.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ogre_header.png)**Ogre-3D** (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a multi-platform  open-source 3D engine. More information at  [ogre3d.org](https://www.ogre3d.org).


## Features

You can easily generate spheric meshes, but also various other geodesic shapes.
* with 5 corner: a pyramid
* with 6 corners: an icoedra
* with 8 corners: a cube
* spheres
* Type C1 ellipsoides
* Type C2 ellipsoides
* adjust the complexity of the shape (ie: the number of triangles)
* etc

## Screenshots
