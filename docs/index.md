# Geometrik Libray for OGRE-3D

## Description

When runing your Ogre-3D program, you may need a runtime-generated 3D object (*mesh*).
For example, entering in a *solar system*, you may need to generate several spheres with diff√©rent diameters on-
the-fly.

This is now possible with the **Geometrik Library**.

**Ogre-3D** (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a multi-platform  open-source 3D engine. More information at  [ogre3d.org](https://www.ogre3d.org).


## Features

You can easily generate spheric meshes, but also various other geodesic shapes.
* Cubes
* Icoedra
* Spheres
* Type C1 ellipsoides
* Type C2 ellipsoides
* Adjustable complexity of the shape (roughly: the number of triangles)

## Screenshots

The [gallery](gallery) presents various meshes created with the **Geometrik Library**.

## API description

You can access the *doxygen* documentation [here](html/index.html) 
with all [C++ classes](html/annotated.html) description.
